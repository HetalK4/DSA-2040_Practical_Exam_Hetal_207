### Sales Analysis Report

The OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) queries helps discover valuable insights from the retail data warehouse which further supports in decision-making. The OLAP queries carried out include: Roll-Up, Drill-Down, and Slice.

Rolling up total sales by country and quarter, aimed to see how each country was performing over the year. I indentifed countries making the most revenue and in this case, it was the United Kindgom.

The drill-down analysis of monthly sales in the UK gave me deeper insights into the seasonal trends. Below are a few insights:

    - There is a general upward trend in sales. The sales for every month are relatively greater than 400,000 sterling apart from the month of February which is slightly less than 400,000 sterling.

    - The months of September, October, and November have a sharp increase in sales compared to the other months. This suggests increases in sales in months closer to Christmas season/holiday season.

    - However, right after the sudden spike in monthly sales for months 9, 10, 11, there is a significant drop in sales in the month of December.

    - This seasonal trend can help with stock planning and providing promotions/discounts to lure more customers. 

The slice query focused specifically on the “Electronics” category. This allowed me to observe monthly sales trends specific to electronics. This helped discover seasonal trends which can further help in stock planning, and promotional campaigns.

In conclusion, these queries help businesses explore trends, monitor top permforming products, thus make informed and strategic decisions across products, and customers.
