This exam is designed to test your practical skills in data warehousing and data mining.

## Section 1: Data Warehousing

### Task 1: Data Warehouse Design

**Scenario:** You are designing a data warehouse for a retail company that sells products across
categories (e.g., electronics, clothing, footwear). The company tracks sales, customers, products, and time.

**2. Explain why you chose star schema over snowflake**

    I chose star schema because it has a straightforward design thus making it faster for read-heavy queries (such as aggregations and reports).
    Unlike snowflake schema, it avoids complex joins by denormalizing the dimension tables, thus faster data processing.
