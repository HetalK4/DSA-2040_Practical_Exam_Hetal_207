This exam is designed to test your practical skills in data warehousing and data mining.

## Section 1: Data Warehousing

### Task 1: Data Warehouse Design

**Scenario:** You are designing a data warehouse for a retail company that sells products across
categories (e.g., electronics, clothing, footwear). The company tracks sales, customers, products, and time.

**2. Explain why you chose star schema over snowflake**

    I chose star schema because it has a straightforward design thus making it faster for read-heavy queries (such as aggregations and reports).
    Unlike snowflake schema, it avoids complex joins by denormalizing the dimension tables, thus faster data processing.

### Task 2: ETL Process Implementation

This is a transactional data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
